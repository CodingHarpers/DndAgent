When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2d4 piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels. The transformation of the ground is camouflaged to look natural. Any creature that can't see the area at the time the spell is cast can make a Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC to recognize the terrain as hazardous before entering it.",
