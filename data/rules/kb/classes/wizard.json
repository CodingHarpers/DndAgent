  "description_text": "The Wizard class uses a d6 for Hit Die. You are proficient with daggers, darts, slings, quarterstaffs, and light crossbows. You are proficient in Intelligence and Wisdom saving throws. You choose two skills from Arcana, History, Insight, Investigation, Medicine, and Religion. At 1st level, you also gain a spellbook.\n\nSpellcasting (Wizard):\nAt 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels.\nAt 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.\n\nThe Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\nYou prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\nIntelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells. Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier. Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.\nYou can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don't need to have the spell prepared.\nYou can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.",
