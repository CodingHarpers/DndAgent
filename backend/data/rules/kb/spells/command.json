You might issue a command other than one described here. If you do so, the GM determines how the target behaves. If the target can't follow your command, the spell ends.***Approach.*** The target moves toward you by the shortest and most direct route, ending its turn if it moves within 5 feet of you.***Drop.*** The target drops whatever it is holding and then ends its turn.***Flee.*** The target spends its turn moving away from you by the fastest available means.***Grovel.*** The target falls prone and then ends its turn.***Halt.*** The target doesn't move and takes no actions. A flying creature stays aloft, provided that it is able to do so. If it must move to stay aloft, it flies the minimum distance needed to remain in the air.",
