  "description_text": "Tieflings mature at the same rate as humans but live a few years longer. Tieflings are about the same size and build as humans. Your size is Medium. You can speak, read, and write Common and Infernal. Tieflings might not have an innate tendency toward evil, but many of them end up there. Evil or not, an independent nature inclines many tieflings toward a chaotic alignment.",
